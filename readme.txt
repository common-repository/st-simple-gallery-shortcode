Takes every image attached to your post or page and displays it as a neat masonry grid or carousel/image slider gallery, via shortcode

== Description ==

ST Simple Gallery Shortcode takes all images attached to a post or page and displays them as a neat gallery via shortcode without the need to define which images should be included, and thus auto-updating whenever something new is attached. Choose between the masonry grid shortcode (with column, order and image size variables) or the carousel shortcode (with order and image size variables). All you have to do is attach some images to your post and decide on a layout, and the shortcode will do the rest.
